# Database challenge

## Principles and rules

- Please use the prepared `.sql` files to solve the tasks.

## Tasks

1. Create the student table with the following fields: `name` and `email`. What columns would you create to represent
   them? Which types and constraints would make sense for a user table?


2. Create the class table, each class has a `name`.
   **Every student can be in only one class.**
   What would you create if we knew that there will be a lot of queries to find a class by name?

3. How would you query every student in a given class by name?

4. Create the subject table, each subject has a name. Every student can attend multiple subjects.
   Where would you store the grades of the students?

5. How would you get the average grade of a students for a given subject by the subject's name?
